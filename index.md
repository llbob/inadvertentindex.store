introText: 'This is "Satellite": the first compilation released by
  inadvertent.index on June 6th 2025. It consists of 20 previously unreleased
  tracks from artists throughout Europe and the US.'
infoBlock1: In creating a compilation, we seek to light a beacon to attract
  music creators and listeners, creating yet another node in a vast rhizome of
  contemporary culture. In compiling ideas, we carve out a slice of the
  ever-expanding cultural canon within the global village of now; everywhere all
  at once, yet with no clear course nor origin. In a contextualized and compiled
  format, the essence ot joint ideas emerge and crystalize.
infoBlock2: A sense of community can be hard to find in a time where more people
  become isolated and echo chambers are rife. This compilation is a small
  gesture to not only create community between music practitioners but also
  translate it into real life solidarity and community.
infoBlock3: This compilation is simply a sliver of time presented on a petri
  dish. Not set to present a certain genre, style or subculture, but rather an
  inadvertent index of contemporary music.
proceedsText: All proceeds are donated to charities of the contributors choice
  and split into equal parts. Charities include St. Luke's Hospice, Situation
  Stockholm, Fondation Marius Jacobs, Friends Of The Earth, UNICEF, Palestine
  Solidarity Campaign, Palestine Children's Relief Fund and Médecins Sans
